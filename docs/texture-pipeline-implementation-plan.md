# Texture Pipeline Integration Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the texture pipeline integration feature (Issue #210) which is currently a MVP BLOCKER. The asset converter already has some texture conversion functionality, but we need to enhance it to fully support Bedrock texture conversion requirements.

## Current State
The AssetConverterAgent in `ai-engine/agents/asset_converter.py` already has:
- Basic texture conversion functionality
- Power-of-2 resizing
- Format conversion to PNG
- Animation data handling from .mcmeta files
- Texture pack structure generation

## Requirements from Issue #210
1. Image format conversion (PNG validation, optimization)
2. Asset path mapping (Java mod structure to Bedrock structure)
3. Texture atlas handling
4. Validation and optimization for Bedrock
5. Fallback generation for edge cases
6. Performance optimization

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Enhance Texture Conversion Algorithm
- Improve PNG validation and optimization
- Add more sophisticated texture atlas handling
- Implement proper fallback generation for edge cases
- Add performance optimizations

### 2. Asset Path Mapping
- Implement proper mapping from Java mod structure to Bedrock structure
- Handle various asset types (blocks, items, entities, etc.)

### 3. Add Comprehensive Testing
- Create unit tests for texture conversion functions
- Add integration tests for the full pipeline
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Profile the current implementation
- Optimize for large texture sets
- Add caching where appropriate

## Files to Modify
1. `ai-engine/agents/asset_converter.py` - Main implementation
2. `ai-engine/tests/test_asset_converter.py` - Unit tests (new file)
3. Documentation updates as needed

## Success Criteria
- Successful extraction and conversion of textures from Java mod JARs
- Correct path mapping to Bedrock structure
- Proper display in Bedrock client
- Handling of edge cases (corrupted files, unsupported formats)
- Suitable performance for large mods

## Dependencies
- Pillow library for image processing (already in requirements)

## Timeline
Estimated implementation time: 2-3 days
