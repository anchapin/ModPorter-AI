# Java to Bedrock Conversion

This project contains a tool to convert Java block definitions to Bedrock format.

## Testing

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
pytest tests/test_mvp_conversion.py
```

This will run the end-to-end MVP test case, which validates the complete pipeline from a Java block to Bedrock files.
