# E2E Test Fixtures

This directory contains test data files used in end-to-end testing.

## Files

- `test-mod.jar` - Sample Java mod file for conversion testing
- `test-texture.png` - Sample texture file for asset testing

## Adding New Fixtures

To add new test files:

1. Place the file in this directory
2. Update the corresponding test files to reference the new fixture
3. Make sure files are small and optimized for testing
4. Include only mock/placeholder data, not real mods
