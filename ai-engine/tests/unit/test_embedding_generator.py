# The MockSentenceTransformer class and mock_sentence_transformer_fixture are now in conftest.py

# Need to import MockSentenceTransformer from conftest if it's used directly in a test,
# e.g. for monkeypatch.setattr(MockSentenceTransformer, "encode", mock_encode_error)
# However, conftest fixtures are globally available, so direct import might not be needed
# if we only refer to the fixture `mock_sentence_transformer_fixture`.
# Let's try without direct import first. If `MockSentenceTransformer` is not defined,
# we might need to import it from `tests.unit.conftest` or adjust how patching is done.
# For patching a class that the fixture provides, we need access to that class's name.
# MockSentenceTransformer is available via conftest.py

# The above import might be tricky depending on pytest's path modifications.
# A common way pytest handles this is by finding conftest.py automatically.
# If MockSentenceTransformer is needed directly (e.g. for `isinstance` or patching its methods),
# it must be importable. The fixture `mock_sentence_transformer_fixture` itself does not expose the class name directly.
# The `monkeypatch.setattr` in `test_generate_embeddings_model_produces_invalid_output`
# needs `MockSentenceTransformer` name.

# Let's assume pytest adds 'ai-engine/tests/unit' to path, or that conftest names are available.
# For robustness, using the full path for the monkeypatch in the test:
# monkeypatch.setattr("ai_engine.tests.unit.conftest.MockSentenceTransformer", "encode", mock_encode_error)
# This is getting complicated. The fixture `mock_sentence_transformer_fixture` already patches
# `src.utils.embedding_generator.SentenceTransformer` to `MockSentenceTransformer`.
# So, inside a test using the fixture, `generator.model` *is* an instance of `MockSentenceTransformer`.
# Thus, `monkeypatch.setattr(generator.model.__class__, "encode", mock_encode_error)` should work.

    # This implies the safety break should be effective.

    # The prompt's assertion `assert "Chunking not progressing due to overlap/chunk_size" in caplog.text`

    # Let's re-check the `embedding_generator.py` code's safety break.
    # `if idx >= chunk_end_idx and (chunk_size - overlap) <=0 :`
    # This will NOT trigger if `idx` is `0` and `chunk_end_idx` is `5`.
    # The `chunk_document` in `embedding_generator.py` provided in previous steps has this refined logic:

# The MockSentenceTransformer inside this file will be moved to conftest.py next.

# The test `test_generate_embeddings_model_produces_invalid_output` also needs `monkeypatch` in its args.
# Corrected `monkeypatch.setattr` in `test_generate_embeddings_model_produces_invalid_output`
# to target `MockSentenceTransformer.encode` as `generator.model.encode` would point to an instance.
# Or, more directly, `MockSentenceTransformer` itself if the mock instance is created fresh.
# The `mock_sentence_transformer_fixture` already patches the ST used by EmbeddingGenerator.
# So, to change `encode` behavior for a specific test, we need to patch the `MockSentenceTransformer`'s `encode` method.
# This is done via `monkeypatch.setattr(MockSentenceTransformer, "encode", mock_encode_error)`.
# And then, importantly, the `EmbeddingGenerator` instance for that test must be created *after* this specific patch
# if the `model_name` influences which mock behavior is chosen (though in this case, `mock_encode_error` is general).
# The fixture `mock_sentence_transformer_fixture` is function-scoped, so the patch applies per test.
# If a test needs to *further* modify the behavior of the mocked `SentenceTransformer` (which is now `MockSentenceTransformer`),
# it should patch `MockSentenceTransformer` directly.
# For `test_generate_embeddings_model_produces_invalid_output`, the `EmbeddingGenerator` is instantiated
# using `generator_with_erroring_model = EmbeddingGenerator(model_name='sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')`.
# This generator will use the `MockSentenceTransformer` due to the fixture.
# Then, we apply `monkeypatch.setattr(MockSentenceTransformer, "encode", mock_encode_error)`.
# This changes the behavior of the `encode` method for *all* instances of `MockSentenceTransformer` created *after* this line
# within the scope of this test, or for existing ones if Python's method resolution for instances is affected dynamically (it is).
# The `generator_with_erroring_model.model` is an instance of `MockSentenceTransformer`. So its `encode` method is now `mock_encode_error`.
# This seems correct.
